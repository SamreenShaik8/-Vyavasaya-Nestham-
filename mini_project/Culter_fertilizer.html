    <h2 style="color:deeppink; margin-bottom:-1px;"><b>Product Description</b></h2>
    <h3>
        <p>CULTAR contains paclobutrazol, a phytoregulator, which acts inhibiting the synthesis of gibberellins, producing a decrease in vegetative growth. The benefit from the use of Cultar manifests itself in a balanced foliage and in the reduction of vegetative growth and pruning. Eventually, effects on fruit quality (color, size, maturation and yield) can also be observed. The absorption of Cultar applied to the soil (more efficient) is done through the roots, being transported by the xylem to the points of vegetative growth. </p>
